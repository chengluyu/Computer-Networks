# Assignment 2

A simulation on channel contending servcie in wireless enviorment. Assuming that 5 stations contends for servcie subject to 802.11 protocol stack. You are required to emulate a 802.11 likely strategy which may lower down the collisions in the network.

## Goals

Obtaining the queue length and waiting time distribution of each station; measuring the collision probability for each station; evaluating the throughput of the whole network.
