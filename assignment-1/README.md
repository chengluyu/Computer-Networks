# Assignment 1

Multi-queue simulation

## Description

A transmission system subject to 3 inputs and only one server. All inputs are characterized by Poisson process and the service time follows an exponential distribution.

## Goal

Explore a scheduling scheme which is able to allocate the service fairly to each of the input in terms of any performance measurement; obtaining the mean queue length, mean waiting time, queue length distribution and waiting time distribution for each queue. Any necessary explaination and statement should be included in the report.
